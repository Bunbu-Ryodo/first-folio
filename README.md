# First-Folio
First Folio is an easy Portfolio Builder for web developers/software engineers (especially junior and intermediate level who want something quick for an upcoming interview). Forms go in, and a shiny portfolio ready for the recruiters come out. 

# Q&A

## Where does the name come from?
I was trying to think of some kind of pun. Something + folio. Settled on First Folio after the collection of Shakespeare's plays. I like literature.

## I want more than one color scheme/theme. Why are there no options?
You don't know what you want. You can't handle all those themes.
