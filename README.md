# First-Folio
First Folio is an easy Portfolio Builder for web developers/software engineers (especially junior and intermediate level who want something quick for an upcoming interview). Forms go in, and a shiny portfolio ready for the recruiters come out. 

# Q&A

## Where does the name come from?
I was trying to think of some kind of pun. Something + folio. Settled on First Folio after the collection of Shakespeare's plays. I like literature.

## I want more than one color scheme/theme. Why are there no options?
You don't know what you want.

## Why no password reset functionality?
I'm going to update the register/login functionality to take an email with a magic link in a later version. But for now, I want people passing by and viewing this app to be able to try it out quickly (rather than get an email link sent to their inbox, having to leave and come back). If you do lose your account, First Folio is designed in such a way that you can get up and running in 5-15 minutes.
